# Agile Software Quality

> How to build software (quickly) that works

## Problem

* Your company is small
* Your software must work
* Your development and testing budgets are small

How do you quickly deliver quality software?

```notes
Imagine you are a small company, trying to capture a piece
of the market. You have to compete with larger established
companies. They have everything: developed products, paying
customers, plans for the future.

You have only some software, maybe a few customers and lots
of plans. How do you compete? How do you have enough resources
to deliver a product that always works? You probably have one
chance to impress a customer. Anything that does not work
damages the relationship since there is no proven track record
to fall on.

## Presenter

Dr. Gleb Bahmutov, PhD computer science, Purdue University.

* ObjectBuilders, 3DDigital, EveryScape
* MathWorks
* uTest (now Applause), Kensho

```notes
I worked mostly in small(er) companies, with the exception
of MathWorks. At Kensho I was given pretty much free reign
to use any tools necessary to deliver good front / back end
software. The process we employ is very different from the
process at MathWorks or even at my other startups.
```

## Starting fresh: the biggest advantage

> As a small starting company you can deliver a feature solving the
customer's EXACT need.

```notes
A company with several customers will be slow to solve one customer's
problem. Even when desired, it will take take, since there are
other customers and legacy support worries.
```

## Quick feature delivery

- MathWorks: at least 6 months
- EveryScape/uTest: at least 1 month
- Kensho: at least 1 hour for small bug fixes / features,
days for larger features.

```notes
Delivering new features or fixing bugs when one does not have to
worry too much about coordinating marketing, sales, etc. is great!

I will not discuss when and how new features should be prioritized.
The product development is completely different topic. For now,
the features we have delivered at Kensho are part of our broad vision
and customer requests that fit this vision.
```

## Quality /= Testing

First observation: *as a small company you cannot test your way to quality*

```notes
You do not have enough human and TIME resources to do enough testing.
MathWorks or Amazon can dedicate weeks and months to testing after
freezing the feature work. You often need to release quickly.
```

## Simplicity rules

> What matters for simplicity is that there's no interleaving
>                          Rich Hickley, the author of Closure

```notes
We consider multi-purpose code a reason to reject commit during
review. Keeping code simpler is more important to us than even
writing fast software, or even covering every possible edge case.
