## Problems

* Keeping tests up to date
* Code coverage collection
  * Speed, flexibility
  * Multi-environment setup
* Fundamental limit
* Code coverage vs input coverage

## Conclusions

* Code coverage is **extremely** useful for small tests
* It is not very useful for large tests
* Do not shoot for 100% code coverage
